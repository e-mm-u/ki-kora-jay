        "answer" : "React is a simple javascript library. It uses the JSX element that  simplifies code writing. We can write javascript and html alike code (jsx) in a single file. It helps to eliminate repetitive codes as it has component that offers using reusable code with different properties. It also use virtual-dom that help to load only things need to be updated rather than refreshing the whole website. This is how react works."
